# Creating an IAM user in AWS

## Introduction

Today I chose creating an IAM user with Admin Access, giving them console access and MFA security because I seen it in a video before and wanted to do it hands on myself and start with the basic functions to start my journey.

## Use Case

- The use of IAM is highly beneficial for anyone using the cloud. It provides everyone from large corporations to the everyday user to secure info while giving abilities (permissions and access) to work using certain policies.

## Cloud Research

- In today's project I ran into a few hiccups (I'm assuming due to me using the AWS playground).
 - It was pretty seemless adding a user with console access.
 - After creating the user, AWS has a pretty seemless, user-friendly creation process because it allowed me to create a group with access and immediately add my new user to that group.
 - The area of difficulty I ran into was because I kept getting an error message to "add permissions" to the user and to "ask the administrator," I coudln't figure out the issue because I already created the group with permissions.
 - The next issue was setting up the MFA for my user, it wouldn't allow me to do any of the options. 1) I don't have any MFA devices and 2) it wouldn't load when I selected the option for MFA apps authenticators.
