# Creating a Lambda Function Using The AWS Console

## Introduction

Today I chose creating a Lambda function just wanting to learn the biggest serverless compute service. This allows me to see how to utilize the Lambda service and functions and this particular lab was based on a url checker to see how a website would return the status code of the site.

## Prerequisite

Before starting this lab it would best to know what Lambda is and the many functions and abilities it work with.

## Use Case

- üñºÔ∏è (Show-Me) Create an graphic or diagram that illustrate the use-case of how this knowledge could be applied to real-world project
- ‚úçÔ∏è (Show-Me) Explain in one or two sentences the use case

## Cloud Research

- ‚úçÔ∏è Document your trial and errors. Share what you tried to learn and understand about the cloud topic or while completing micro-project.
- üñºÔ∏è Show as many screenshot as possible so others can experience in your cloud research.


### Step 1 ‚Äî Creating the Lambda function using "author from scratch" and using "node.js"

### Step 2 ‚Äî Showing the function successfully created.

### Step 3 ‚Äî Creating the test event to capture the status code of the website.

### Step 4 ‚Äî After creating the test event you can see that test came back with the status code of "200" meaning the site is up running actively.

### Step 5 ‚Äî Checking the CloudWatch Logs for the function, viewing the log streams.

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud Outcome

‚úçÔ∏è (Result) Describe your personal outcome, and lessons learned.

## Next Steps

Next for me would be to learn how to perform more functions using Lambda. I believe it would have a huge use case for DevOps teams which is my goal.

## Social Proof

‚úçÔ∏è Show that you shared your process on Twitter or LinkedIn
