# Creating an Azure Virtual machine

## Introduction

Today's project was based from my work in my boot camp, as I'm going through and learning I went ahead captured the process that I went through in the demo to make 
I'm paying attention and grasping the information of what is being done and shown.

## Prerequisite

Basic knowledge suggested, just knowing what a VM is and how they are used.

## Use Case

- üñºÔ∏è (Show-Me) Create an graphic or diagram that illustrate the use-case of how this knowledge could be applied to real-world project
- ‚úçÔ∏è (Show-Me) Explain in one or two sentences the use case

## Cloud Research

- This is a beginners project however there are things you still want to make sure you are doing correctly to not mess up on your creation. I'm a fan of the "back" 
button and when I hit that it started the entire process over for creating the VM. Also when creating your resource group, make sure the name spelling is correct
(silly mistake) but yea.. Other than than that, easy and seemless process. Enjoy the steps!

### Step 1 ‚Äî When creating your VM make sure you have all of your creation details at hand. (You can also see the tabs of info you will need).

### Step 2 ‚Äî After going through the creation screens you will create your VM will need to validate and it will start deploying your resources.
