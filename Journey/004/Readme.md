# Creating an Azure Virtual machine

## Introduction

Today's project was based from my work in my boot camp, as I'm going through and learning I went ahead captured the process that I went through in the demo to make 
I'm paying attention and grasping the information of what is being done and shown.

## Prerequisite

Basic knowledge suggested, just knowing what a VM is and how they are used.

## Use Case

- This is pretty self-explanatory as creating and running VMs is highly needed in the use case of almost every business as migrating to the cloud becomes very
widely used.
- But for anyone who is very new, a VM is a way to isolate each process of running an app on an OS.

## Cloud Research

- This is a beginners project however there are things you still want to make sure you are doing correctly to not mess up on your creation. I'm a fan of the "back" 
button and when I hit that it started the entire process over for creating the VM. Also when creating your resource group, make sure the name spelling is correct
(silly mistake) but yea.. Other than than that, easy and seemless process. Enjoy the steps!

### Step 1 — When creating your VM make sure you have all of your creation details at hand. (You can also see the tabs of info you will need).

### Step 2 — After going through the creation screens you will create your VM will need to validate and it will start deploying your resources.

### Step 3 — Next is just checking in your resource group that you created and viewing all of the resources that were deployed.

### Step 4 — Following checking the resources, you can go into your VM and "connect" to it, downloading the RDP file. *Use your login credentials*

### Step 5 — *I have and outdated OS on my mac that I forgot to update so I took the screenshot from the demo*. This image shows once you connect to the VM (in this case a fully functioning VM) and ready to run workloads.

## ☁️ Cloud Outcome

Result: I was able to successfully create an Azure VM. I wasn't sure how it would be, I've been doing AWS more the Azure so this was an eye opener of how 
user-friendly Azure can be and it was fun to see this process.

## Next Steps

Next, I would like to learn more about Azure and its functionality, as the cloud for me is more amazing to learn everyday!
