# Create and Work with an EC2 Instance in AWS

## Introduction

Today I didn't have any real reason for this project, just continuing beginner work in the cloud and this was the first thing that popped up.

## Prerequisite

Base knowledge before beginning this project that I recommend would be knowing EC2, VPC, networks and subnets.

## Use Case

EC2 is extrememly beneficial in the cloud and the most commonly is used for hosting a variety of applications, software and websites on the cloud. 

## Cloud Research

- With working in the AWS playground you're not able to access everything, with that being said I wasn't able to connect to the EC2 console but was still provided with an image of what it would look like if I did.

### Step 1 — To start we saved a lot of time by just creating a default VPC designed by AWS.

### Step 2 — The first step you want to take of course is launching an EC2 instance and here we also selected this particular AMI.

### Step 3 — After going through setting up your settings for you EC2 you can launch it and see that it's running.

### Step 4 — Next we are verifying that the web server is runnig properly. That is performed by copying the public DNS name and paste it into a new webpage.
- Which will bring you to this Apache test page, indicating the web server is successfully configured and running.

### Step 5 — In this step (showing) we are connecting to our EC2 instance in the terminal.

### Step 6 — Final picture of the project just displays that when the instance is "stopped" there is no IP info available. However if the instance is running or in reboot mode it will still show IP address.

## ☁️ Cloud Outcome

Results for today was successfully creating an EC2 instance and messing around in the lab seeing the different states of the instance.

## Next Steps

Next steps for me is to keep learning and growing and be versatile!
