# Creating a Blob Storage

## Introduction

Today's project was another beginner lesson in Azure, getting down the basics/ fundamentals.

## Prerequisite

For this lesson I would just recommend learning the different Storage Services offered by Azure and the use case of each.

## Use Case

#### Azure Blob Storage:
Massively scalable and secure object storage for cloud-native workloads, archives, data lakes, high-performance computing, and machine learning.

## Cloud Research

- Research: Understanding the different types of storage that are available and finding ways to be able to showcase for a project.

## Try yourself

Azure should have some demos or tutorials to follow if you have trouble following the presented steps.

### Step 1 — Create your storage and input your configuration to your liking, following all guidelines. Go through configuration utilizing default settings until validation and creation is complete like shown.

### Step 2 — Next, you want to open the resource group, open storage account and under "data storage" in the left side pane (like shown) you want to create a container.

### Step 3 — When creating your container for the access level select "anonymous read access for containers and blobs."

### Step 4 — Open the container, upload any files that you want to upload

### Step 5 — Select the 3 dots and you can access the full content of the file.

### Step 6 — If you select the 3 dots and select "properties," copy the URL and paste it into a browser. You will see that it opens up (like 2nd photo), meaning the storage content is now available globally via the URL.

## ☁️ Cloud Outcome

Result: Successfully created a Blob Storage via Azure and added files to provide my storage content globally. Amazingly seamless process through Azure so no mistakes were made.

## Next Steps

Keep learning!
