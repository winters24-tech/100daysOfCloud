# Using the Command Line

## Introduction

Today I chose to use the command line to get more familiar with Linux as I also learn it in my boot camp. The more repetition, the better the learning.

## Prerequisite

Recommended to have an A cloud guru free tier account to follow a demo or any free to use terminal.

## Use Case

- Bash scripts can be used for various purposes, such as executing a shell command, running multiple commands together, customizing administrative tasks, performing task automation etc. Therefore learning bash programming is beneficial for Linux users.

### Step 1 — To start, we're going to use ssh to connect to the remote server. Agree and log in.

### Step 2 — Now that we're logged in, we'll run a few simple commands just to see the returns of the commands.

### Step 4 — After clearing the page we will now run the "man" command added in front of those same commands used previously. Starting with "man whoami." Second image is the display of the command ran.

## ☁️ Cloud Outcome

Successfully connect to remote the remote server and used basic commands.

## Next Steps

The next few days I will build my learning with Bash and Linux.
