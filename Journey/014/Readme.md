# Using Bash To Write a Backup Script

## Introduction

As explained in day 13, I am currently learning Linux and some Bash scripting in my boot camp so its a great repetitive learning for me.

## Prerequisite

Review day 13, the same applies to today.

## Use Case

- Bash scripting offers functional improvements for both programming and interactive use.

### Step 1 — Let's get logged in and do a quick check of ls and run the command on the work directory.

### Step 2 — Now, we're going to run the "vim backup.sh" command.

### Step 3 — Next, let's add an echo note to log our activity and run the "mkdir" command to create the backup directory. Also, add echo notes to log the activity and run the "cp" command to copy files into the backup directory. (It should look like this). Run the ":wq" command, save and quit.

### Step 4 — After getting all of that setup we'll go ahead and run these commands shown in the image to create an executable and run the script.

### Step 5 — We're not getting an output so we'll run "ls" to show the directory.

### Step 6 — Lastly we'll "cat" backup logs and verify everything was created and backed up. If successful, it should show as created the files, copying files, list the files and at the bottom that we finished copying files.
